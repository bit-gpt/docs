## Payment Lifecycle

The h402 handshake distills every payment into five deterministic steps. Each step yields a machine-readable artifact that survives retries, failovers or audits:

1. **Quote**: Server responds with HTTP 402 and a Quote header containing payment routes, unit price, expiry timestamp or a unique nonce.

2. **Authorize**: Client produces a deterministic authorization artifact (such as EVM permit signatures).

3. **Broadcast** (Post-broadcast Flow): Client broadcasts the transaction on-chain. Required for post-broadcast validation flows.

4. **Validate**: Server requires proof of on-chain inclusion before service delivery. While for transaction that haven't yet been broadcasted get checked out against the paymentRequirements.

5. **Settle** (Server-broadcasted Flow): Required only for permit-like payment validation not broadcasted before validation.

Each artifact is self-describing and hash-stable, allowing any component to reconstruct state without trusting a live database.

## Protocol Roles

### Client

- Initiates resource requests
- Processes 402 responses and payment instructions
- Generates authorization artifacts

### Server

- Issues 402 responses with payment requirements
- Controls resource access
- Remains completely stateless

### Facilitator

- Handles transaction verification
- Manages settlement processes
- Maintains necessary state

### Wallet

- Executes payment operations
- Can be user-controlled or autonomous
- Requires no h402-specific implementation

## Design Tenets

### Chain-Plural

- Multiple settlement networks as first-class options
- Single Quote can expose parallel price routes
- No vendor lock-in or chain maximalism

### Deterministic

- Every step produces immutable artifacts
- Self-describing proofs enable stateless verification
- No hidden session state required (except Facilitator)
