<Info>
  The protocol is fully [open source](https://github.com/bit-gpt/h402) and under
  active development.
</Info>

**h402 is an open, HTTP-compatible protocol that enables stateless machine-to-machine payments.**

Thirty-five years after Tim Berners-Lee set aside the 402 Payment Required response code, the web still lacks a native, programmable unit of value. h402 aims to close this gap by providing a thin, header-based payment primitive that integrates directly into any HTTP interaction.

## Overview

h402 repurposes the unused `402 Payment Required` HTTP status code to introduce a simple and interoperable payment negotiation mechanism between clients and services. It enables:

- Machine-to-machine payments using native blockchain assets
- Service monetization without centralized payment gateways
- Stateless, cryptographically verifiable interactions
- Cross-chain and token-agnostic design

Any HTTP-capable agent or service can adopt h402 to define access requirements, request payment and verify them using our protocol.

## Key Capabilities

- **Chain-Plural**: The protocol treats multiple settlement networks (EVM chains, Solana and soon many others) as first-class options.
- **HTTP-Native**: Seamless integration with existing web infrastructure through standard headers and status codes.
- **Extensible**: Support for new payment schemes, compliance requirements, and future network integrations.
- **Production-Ready**: Built for real-world deployment with comprehensive tooling and facilitator support.

<Note>
  While clients operate in a completely stateless manner, the Facilitator
  maintains state for transaction verification and settlement.

## Use Cases

h402 enables a new market layer for code, including:

- **Instant-Settlement Service Calls**: LLM inference, real-time market data, per-frame video analytics
- **Compute & Storage Markets**: GPU spot markets, elastic storage, DePIN rewards
- **Context & Content on Demand**: Per-document legal archives, premium content, scientific datasets
- **Device-to-Device Commerce**: EV charging, factory automation, logistics coordination
