The h402 Facilitator is a crucial component that handles transaction verification and settlement. This guide will help you set up and run your own Facilitator instance.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bit-gpt/h402.git
cd h402/typescript/facilitator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .example.env .env
```

## Configuration

Edit your `.env` file with the following required settings:

```env
# General configuration
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKey
PORT=3000
ADMIN_TOKEN=secure_token

# RPC configuration
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://rpc.com
BASE_RPC_URL=https://rpc.com
BSC_RPC_URL=https://rpc.com

# Backup configuration (Required)
BACKUP_SCHEDULE=*/30 * * * *
KEEP_BACKUPS=7

# S3 backup configuration (Required)
S3_ENDPOINT=s3.com
S3_ACCESS_KEY=keyHere
S3_SECRET_KEY=secretHere
S3_BUCKET=bucketName

# Redis Configuration (Required)
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

## Running the Facilitator

```bash
# For Development
npm run dev && npm run start:redis && npm run start:worker

# For Production
npm run start
```

The Facilitator will be available at `http://localhost:{PORT}`.

## Core Features

The Facilitator provides several essential services:

- **Transaction Verification**: Validates payment proofs across multiple chains
- **Settlement Management**: Handles the settlement process for different payment schemes
- **State Management**: Maintains necessary state for broadcasted transactions
- **Chain Integration**: Interfaces with multiple blockchain networks as the h402

## Security Considerations

1. **Private Key Management**

   - Hanle the private keys with care to prevent unwanted leaks
   - Consider using a key management service in production
   - Rotate the private keys periodically

2. **Network Security**

   - Run behind a reverse proxy
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use SSL/TLS in production

3. **Access Control**
   - Configure allowed origins
   - Implement secure token for admin routes
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

## Production Deployment

For production environments, consider:

1. **Monitoring**

   - Set up logging aggregation
   - Configure an alert system

2. **Performance**
   - Use custom RPC
   - Configure proper timeouts

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

<Accordion title="Connection Issues">
  - Check RPC endpoint availability
  - Verify network connectivity
  - Ensure proper environment configuration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transaction Settlement Failures">
  Confirm proper private key configuration, you must include the `0x` in the env variables
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Problems">
  - Monitor Redis connection
  - Check RPC endpoint performance
