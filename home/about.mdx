**BitGPT is building the foundational infrastructure for autonomous software.**  

We are a company focused on creating the protocols, tools and standards that enable AI agents, digital systems and autonomous software to independently participate in economic activities and much more.

## Mission

We believe the future of the internet will be shaped by autonomous agents—systems that can negotiate, collaborate and transact without human intervention. These agents need robust, trustless infrastructure to operate, communicate and exchange value.

Our mission is to build the essential building blocks that allow machines to interact and collaborate effectively, creating the foundation for a truly autonomous internet.

## Principles

- **Research-Driven Development**  
  Our work is grounded in rigorous research, conducted by the experts in our team, allowing us to stay ahead.

- **Open Infrastructure**  
  We build public goods. Our core protocols and tools are open source and permissionless.

- **Autonomous-First Design**  
  We design with machine agents as primary users, ensuring our solutions work at AI speed and scale.

- **Network & Platform Neutrality**  
  Our infrastructure works across different systems and use cases, without favoring any single ecosystem.
